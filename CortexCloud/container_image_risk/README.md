#### Description

This dashboard displays detected container images over time and where they are detected in the SDLC (runtime, build, deploy).
Each detected container image is assigned a weighted risk score based on the number and severity of vulnerabilities detected.
The weighted risk score is calculated by the following formula:

---

Temporal = $$\left(Critical \times 25\right) + \left(High \times 15\right) + \left(Medium \times 5\right) + \left(Low \times 1\right)$$

Risk = $$\left(\frac{Temporal}{Temporal + 100}\right) \times 100$$

---

> [!NOTE]
> The highest risk score is 100, and the lowest risk score is 0. If malware is detected on a container image the risk score is set to 90.

In addtion, the dashboard displays the most common container images found on hosts, and identifies vulnerable container image packages using [sematic versioning](https://semver.org/) that have patch fixes available.
